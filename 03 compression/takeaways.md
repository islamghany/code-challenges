## Huffman Encoder/Decoder

Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies. The most frequent characters are assigned the shortest codes, and the least frequent characters are assigned the longest codes.

The algorithm works by building a binary tree called the Huffman tree. The tree is constructed by repeatedly combining the two least frequent characters into a new node until all characters are part of the tree. The codes are then generated by traversing the tree from the root to each character, assigning 0 for left branches and 1 for right branches.

The encoder takes the input text, calculates the frequencies of each character, builds the Huffman tree, and generates the encoded binary data. The decoder takes the encoded binary data, reconstructs the Huffman tree, and decodes the data by traversing the tree based on the encoded bits.

for example, if we have the following input text:

```
AABBBCCD
```

The Huffman tree might look like this:

```
       root
      /    \
     C      root
          /    \
         D      root
              /    \
             B      root
                  /    \
                 A      B
```

The encoded data might look like this:

```
101110111011011101
```

The decoder would then traverse the tree based on the encoded bits to reconstruct the original input text.

Huffman encoding is widely used in file compression algorithms like ZIP and JPEG to reduce the size of files without losing any information.
