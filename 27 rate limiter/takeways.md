# Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of traffic sent or received by a network. It is used to prevent abuse of the network and to ensure that the network is used in a fair manner. Rate limiting can be implemented in various ways, such as by limiting the number of requests that can be sent to a server in a given time period, or by limiting the amount of data that can be sent or received in a given time period.

**To implement rate limiting, you can use the following techniques:**

1. Token Bucket Algorithm
2. Leaky Bucket Algorithm
3. Fixed Window Algorithm
4. Sliding Window Counter Algorithm
5. Sliding Window Log Algorithm

## 1. Token Bucket Algorithm

Description
Design Link: Figma Design Link

Details:
Implement the "Replying to" section as per the design, specifically for Public Twitter interactions.

The "Replying to" section will appear above the reply box.
This section should display the original poster (always shown as the first name) along with any additional users involved in the comment thread.
Ticket Scope:
Ensure the "Replying to" section is only visible in Public Twitter interactions.
Test Cases:
Ensure the "Replying to" section list is displayed as per the design, with:

Correct title.
User list showing the original poster first and other participants.
Menu icon as shown in the design.
Ensure the "Replying to" section does not appear in any non-Twitter or private Twitter interactions.
