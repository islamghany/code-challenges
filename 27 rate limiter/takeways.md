# Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of traffic sent or received by a network. It is used to prevent abuse of the network and to ensure that the network is used in a fair manner. Rate limiting can be implemented in various ways, such as by limiting the number of requests that can be sent to a server in a given time period, or by limiting the amount of data that can be sent or received in a given time period.

**To implement rate limiting, you can use the following techniques:**

1. Token Bucket Algorithm
2. Leaky Bucket Algorithm
3. Fixed Window Algorithm
4. Sliding Window Counter Algorithm
5. Sliding Window Log Algorithm

## 1. Token Bucket Algorithm
